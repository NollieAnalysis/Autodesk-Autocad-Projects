# Traffic Control Plan Examples

Start by finding a location in Google Earth, zoom into a specific scale (I chose 100 feet), and save the image. Below is an example.

Upload the image into Autocad, align / scale image to same scale from Google Earth. Repeat these steps and align Google Earth images together to create large maps.

Trace the outline of applicable map details (i.e. roads, curbs, etc.) and add additional traffic control details. Hide layers when ready to print.
